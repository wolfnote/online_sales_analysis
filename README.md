Online Sales Analysis

Project Overview:
The Online Sales Analysis project is a simple Python-based shopping cart system. It allows users to:

Manage a list of available products.
Add products to a shopping cart.
Calculate the total price of selected items.
Randomly select products to be added to the cart.
This project follows object-oriented programming (OOP) principles and provides a modular and extensible structure.

Project Structure:

product.py - Defines the Product class.
product_manager.py - Manages product inventory (add, remove, display).
cart.py - Shopping cart functionalities.
main.py - Entry point of the application.
.gitignore - Excludes sensitive files (config.json, screenshots).
README.md - Project documentation.
config.json (ignored) - Example API key storage (not tracked in Git).
Classes & Functionalities:

1Ô∏è‚É£ Product (product.py)
Represents an individual product with the following attributes:

name - The name of the product.
price - The price of the product.
quantity - The number of units available.
Example Usage:
product = Product("Laptop", 1200, 5)
print(product.display_info()) # Output: Product: Laptop, Price: 1200, Quantity: 5

2Ô∏è‚É£ ProductManager (product_manager.py)
Manages the inventory of products.

Features:
‚úî Add a product
‚úî Remove a product by name
‚úî Display all available products
‚úî Calculate the total inventory value

Example Usage:
manager = ProductManager()
manager.add_product(Product("Phone", 800, 3))
manager.display_all_products()

3Ô∏è‚É£ Cart (cart.py)
Handles the shopping cart, allowing users to add and view products.

Features:
‚úî Add a product to the cart
‚úî Display cart contents
‚úî Calculate the total cart value

Example Usage:
cart = Cart()
cart.add_to_cart(Product("Monitor", 300, 2), 2)
cart.display_cart()
print(cart.calculate_total())

4Ô∏è‚É£ Main Script (main.py)
Orchestrates the entire program.

Steps Performed:

Creates a ProductManager instance.
Adds products to the inventory.
Creates a Cart instance.
Randomly selects 3 products and adds them to the cart.
Displays the cart contents and total price.
Example Usage:
python main.py

Running the Project:

1Ô∏è‚É£ Clone the Repository:
git clone https://github.com/wolfnote/online_sales_analysis.git

2Ô∏è‚É£ Run the Main Script:
python main.py

Security Measures:

The project ignores config.json (which contains sensitive API keys).
Screenshots (.png, .jpg, etc.) are excluded to keep the repository clean.
See the .gitignore file for excluded items.
Future Improvements:
‚úÖ Implement a database to store products.
‚úÖ Add a Graphical User Interface (GUI).
‚úÖ Improve product filtering and search functionality.
